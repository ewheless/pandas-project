                According to officals, New York is about to see its worst week yet in terms of number of deaths due to COVID-19. As news and rules around the virus change, many of us are asking the wizard (aka searching Google) to answer our questions - what does shelter in place mean? How do I make a homemade facemask? How do I make bread?

                    We'll take a look at Google search trends over time, compared to the timeline of comfirmed cases and deaths in the US. All data is from the US, ranging from January 22, 2020 to April 6, 2020. Google search trends are measured using an index of 0 to 100, with 100 meaning that the term was at its most searched. The data on cases comes from the <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins COVID tracker</a>.

                    About a week after the spike in searches for "coronavirus", searches jumped for "shelter in place". At this point, about 44,000 cases had been confirmed in the US.

                    Searches for facemask patterns soared this past weekend after Mayor Bill de Blasio encouraged New Yorkers to wear a mask when going outside, and the CDC revised its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html">guidelines</a> on facemasks. Now many of us are looking for how to make one at home.

                    There is one search term that has grow, or should we say, risen, in popularity - searches for bread! Many of us are turning to bread baking to pass the time, and shortages of yeast and flour in stores have many folks searching for it online. Searches for "bread yeast" have spiked and remained fairly high as more stay home orders were rolled out.
